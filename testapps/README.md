These are all test .swai files for certain situations

## Apple Music
This is currently the only test that is a full web app. This app is a full web app that requires DRM, light/dark switching, and a few other features. This is a good test for the full capabilities of SWAI.

## Custom Right Click
This was used to make sure the context menu didn't interfere with websites that implement their own context menus. This is a good test for the context menu.

## html5test
This loads a website that tests the browser's html5 capabilities. This was here early on just to make sure most web apps should work in Electron.

## scrolltest
Was using to make sure our custom scrollbars worked without breaking sites that have their own custom scrollbars.
